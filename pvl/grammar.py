"""Describes the language aspects of PVL dialects.

These grammar objects are not particularly meant to be easily
user-modifiable during running of an external program, which is why
they have no arguments at initiation time, nor are there any methods
or functions to modify them.  This is because these grammar objects
are used both for reading and writing PVL-text.  As such, objects
like PVLGrammar and ODLGrammar shouldn't be altered, because if
they are, then the PVL-text written out with them wouldn't conform
to the spec.

Certainly, these objects do have attributes that can be altered,
but unless you've carefully read the code, it isn't recommended.

Maybe someday we'll add a more user-friendly interface to allow that,
but in the meantime, just leave an Issue on the GitHub repo.
